# Crowdsourcing Citizen Science in Agriculture 


## Overview

Here you find all the training materials for **tricot** crowdsourcing citizen science projects. Tricot, stands for "triadic comparison of technologies", an approach developed by [Bioversity International](https://www.bioversityinternational.org/) for the rapid assessment of on-farm evaluation trails in small-scale agriculture[@VanEtten2016]. 

To create your project, please visit the [ClimMob](https://climmob.net/blog/) portal. 

### Methodological approach

In the **tricot** approach, each participant receives a set of technologies (generally three) randomly allocated as incomplete blocks from a larger set. It maintains spatial balance by assigning roughly equal frequencies of the varieties to each area. The trials required three moments of contact with the participants: (*i*) explaining the experiment and distributing the trial technologies, (*ii*) collecting evaluation data, and (*iii*) returning the results[@VanEtten2016].

Participants' independent observations are compiled and analysed centrally. A simple ranking-based feedback format allows even participants with low literacy skills to contribute their evaluation data through various channels, including mobile telephones.

### Evidence on the tricot approach 

Current evidence has demonstrated that: (*i*) the **tricot** approach engage motivated participants as citizen scientists[@Beza2017]; (*ii*) the data generated by citizen scientists is reliable and can produce meaningful results for agricultural research[@Steinke2017]; (*iii*) the approach can engage farmers into the discussion for the future of local, sustainable plant breeding efforts[@Mancini2017]; (*iv*) addresses the challenge of variety replacement for climate adaptation in a way that is, at the same time, scalable and demand led[@VanEtten2019].
